# Example Child Theme Kit

## Description

This is a "getting started" child theme kit inspired by the Standard Child Theme Kit created by 8bit. This is not a standalone theme, it requires a parent theme.

## Installation

*Note: Standard 3 must be installed first for the Standard Child Theme Kit to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Not included

Sorry, no details here. Just skip to the FTP option.

### Using FTP

1. Connect to your server via FTP.
2. Upload the extracted ```example-child-theme-kit``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
3. Rename the "example-child" folder to match the name of your parent theme folder
4. Edit the style.css and name the child theme whatever you want.
5. Enter other information about the theme, as appropriate.
6. Make sure the "Template" entry exactly matches the name of your parent folder.
7. Upload a custom screenshot.png for WordPress to use (or just leave the one have). 
8. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
9. Locate "Example Child Theme Kit" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Standard Child Theme Kit and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Standard.

If you happened to name Standard 3 theme directory anything else besides "standard" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Standard Child Theme Kit's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
