# Palette Child Theme for Canvas by WooThemes

## Description

Let's face it. WooThemes Canvas is a nice basic framework for building out a site, but it leaves a lot to be desired in the bells & whistles department.

Originally inspired by the Child Theme Kit created by 8bit. Palette is a child theme for the WooThemes Canvas theme, and attempts to provide a framework for sprucing up the Canvas home page a little.

Palette includes support and styling for:
* Testimonials by WooThemes
* Features by WooThemes
* Our Team by WooThemes
* Projects by WooThemes (in progress)
* WooSlider by WooThemes (paid plugin)
* Gravity Forms (in progress)

It also integrates the Font Awesome icons into the WooThemes features section, and relies heavily on Advanced Custom Fields for various functionality.

Palette also extends the WooThemes Options framework and seeks to make Canvas more flexible and wonderful.

This is not a standalone theme, it requires a parent theme. Specifically, it requires the Canvas Theme by WooThemes.

## Installation

*Note: Canvas by WooThemes must be installed first for Palette to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Installing via WordPress Dashboard

Sorry, no details here. Just skip to the FTP option.

### Using FTP

1. Connect to your server via FTP.
2. Upload the extracted ```example-child-theme-kit``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
3. Rename the "example-child" folder to match the name of your parent theme folder
4. Edit the style.css and name the child theme whatever you want.
5. Enter other information about the theme, as appropriate.
6. Make sure the "Template" entry exactly matches the name of your parent folder. In this case, the "Template" entry should be "canvas."
7. Upload a custom screenshot.png for WordPress to use (or just leave the one I have). 
8. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
9. Locate "Palette" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Customize Canvas through the Canvas Theme Options You can add your own styles in the ```Custom CSS``` section of the Theme Options to override any styles that aren't readily manipulable in the Palette options panel.

If you happened to name the Canvas theme directory anything else besides "canvas" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Palette's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find support?
* I'm actively developing this theme, so let me know if you'd like to see a feature or find any issues. For help with something or to report a bug, feel free to shoot an email to john@pancakecreative.com.

### How much does this theme cost?
* This theme is currently in alpha, and will remain FREE until I've worked out all the kinks and cleaned up the code to sufficiently call it "marketable." At that point I'll probably request a nominal fee to help cover time spent developing updates and providing support.
