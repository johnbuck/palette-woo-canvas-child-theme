# Example Child Theme Kit

## Description

This is a child theme for WooThemes canvas originally inspired by the Child Theme Kit created by 8bit. This is not a standalone theme, it requires a parent theme. Specifically, it requires the Canvas Theme by WooThemes.

## Installation

*Note: Canvas by WooThemes must be installed first for Palette to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Installing via WordPress Dashboard

Sorry, no details here. Just skip to the FTP option.

### Using FTP

1. Connect to your server via FTP.
2. Upload the extracted ```example-child-theme-kit``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
3. Rename the "example-child" folder to match the name of your parent theme folder
4. Edit the style.css and name the child theme whatever you want.
5. Enter other information about the theme, as appropriate.
6. Make sure the "Template" entry exactly matches the name of your parent folder. In this case, the "Template" entry should be "canvas."
7. Upload a custom screenshot.png for WordPress to use (or just leave the one I have). 
8. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
9. Locate "Palette" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Standard Child Theme Kit and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles in the Theme Optoins to override the styles that come with Palette.

If you happened to name the Canvas theme directory anything else besides "cavnas" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Standard Child Theme Kit's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
